# eCommerce frontend test assignment
#### by Nikolay Kashuba for Junior React Developer position in Scandiweb.

### About
This is my first serious JS project. I had fun and learned a lot, the process itself was pretty exciting as with every change there's as much stuff happening on screen as under the hood.

Requires GraphQL endpoint: [Original](https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint) / [Safekeeping Fork](https://github.com/reepotah/junior-react-endpoint).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installation

1. Clone repo
2. Clone and start the required endpoint
3. In the progect directory run `npm i`, `npm start`
